# IXP-Settings-Fleasion-real-
Replaces roblox's IXP with a custom IXP that reroutes roblox to use Fleasion.
  Steps are use the path:  
  Windows>users>youruser>appdata>local>roblox>ClientSettings.  
  
  Inside this ClientSettings folder you will see IxpSettings.json, rename this file to "IxpSettings(1).json".  
  
  And then download my ZIP.  Inside my zip you will see a file called "IxpSettings.json"  copy and paste this file into the ClientSettings folder.

  After this you can just run the .bat in my zip file, and then Fleasion, and it will work.

  (If it stopps working after rejoin just re run the zip)
